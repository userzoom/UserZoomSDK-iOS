Developer's use of the SDK is governed by the license in the applicable UserZoom [Terms of Service][terms].

A commercial UserZoom SDK license allows using the UserZoom SDK within your own. Any results obtained by using a commercial UserZoom SDK license may be used for commercial purposes. A distribution of own networks or modules is permitted. However, redistribution of the UserZoom SDK, either completely or in parts, or using the UserZoom software or parts thereof for commercial products or services is not permitted. Thus, it is not permitted to combine a commercial distribution of own networks or modules with the UserZoom runtime environment.

The Customer must only use the Service as intended by UserZoom. The Customer must not copy or share the Service or the code on which the Service is based (or in any other way violate UserZoom intellectual property rights).

The dealings with the participants (or any other possible user) interacting with the software application, in which a UserZoom SDK is integrated, or with a UserZoom Application are between the Customer and the participants. The Customer is, in relation to UserZoom, thus solely responsible for the participants and their legal rights and obligations related to the Service.

The UserZoom website, UserZoom SDKs and UserZoom Applications are the property of UserZoom and violation of any intellectual property right connected thereto is deemed as copyright infringement. The Service is not sold to the Customer by approving these Terms of Use, through the integration with any software application or by using a UserZoom Application, and UserZoom retains ownership of the Service and the code on which the Service is based.

The Customer must not change, modify, adapt or alter the Service or change, modify or alter another website or service so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Service or UserZoom.
The integration of UserZoom’s SDK does not grant the Customer any right to use UserZoom’s domain names, service marks, logos or any other features attributable to UserZoom.
